# Integrity Checkarr

This application aims to provide a tool which monitors your movie collection and watches out for corrupt video files which are not integer.
This may happen due to errors while copying or downloading files from a server.
Moreover, **Integrity Checkarr** provides a nice dashboard built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).

You can run **Integrity Checkarr** via docker by simply running the `docker-compose.yml` provided in this repo.
